\chapter*{Supporting Technologies}\label{chap:technologies}

\noindent
This section should present a detailed summary, in bullet point form,
of any third-party resources (e.g., hardware and software components)
used during the project.  Use of such resources is always perfectly
acceptable: the goal of this section is simply to be clear about how
and where they are used, so that a clear assessment of your work can
result.  The content can focus on the project topic itself (rather,
for example, than including ``I used \mbox{\LaTeX} to prepare my
dissertation''); an example is as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item I used the Java {\tt BigInteger} class to support my implementation
      of RSA.
\item I used a parts of the OpenCV computer vision library to capture
      images from a camera, and for various standard operations (e.g.,
      threshold, edge detection).
\item I used an FPGA device supplied by the Department, and altered it
      to support an open-source UART core obtained from
      \url{http://opencores.org/}.
\item The web-interface component of my system was implemented by
      extending the open-source WordPress software available from
      \url{http://wordpress.org/}.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
