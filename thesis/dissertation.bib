  abstract =     {Many developments have taken place within dataflow programming
                  languages in the past decade. In particular, there has been a
                  great deal of activity and advancement in the field of
                  dataflow visual programming languages. The motivation for this
                  article is to review the content of these recent developments
                  and how they came about. It is supported by an initial review
                  of dataflow programming in the 1970s and 1980s that led to
                  current topics of research. It then discusses how dataflow
                  programming evolved toward a hybrid von Neumann dataflow
                  formulation, and adopted a more coarse-grained approach.
                  Recent trends toward dataflow visual programming languages are
                  then discussed with reference to key graphical dataflow
                  languages and their development environments. Finally, the
                  article details four key open topics in dataflow programming
                  languages.},
